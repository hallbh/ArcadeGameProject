Shiny new bells and whistles:

With base functionality pretty much set, we added music and sfx.
We attempted to add a final boss (on the last level), but it is riddled with bugs.
Caleb and Ben were both quite busy, so some individual coding happened, but most was pair programming with fairly equal time driving and navigating

Added the statspanel, which has a timer counting down, doesn't count down to anything yet, and a lives counter, which actually counts
Making all of the sprites for 0-9 took a fair amount of time.

Implemented a firewalk powerup

Some bugs still exist in the code, game breaking bugs.
This project has given me great perspective on the scope of cs projects, and the time it takes to effectively program

If we were to do it again we would implement unit tests from the start, but that's a pipe dream trying to add it now,
so we could attempt to avoid breaking parts of our code when fixing other places.

The game works to a very nice degree, but not being able to organically move between levels is frustrating
