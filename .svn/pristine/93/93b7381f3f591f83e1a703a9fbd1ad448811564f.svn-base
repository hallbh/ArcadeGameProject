Ben coded for about 2 hours on the abstract game object and the classes that extend it, as well as starting to implement
the keyboard listener

Caleb Coded for the next 2 hours working on trying to get LevelPanel to draw the level, to no avail. We are having major
issues with BufferedImage and are stuck, so we are going to throw in the towel for the night and talk to Dr. Wilkin 
tomorrow.

Met in computer lab and worked on collisions
Then met with Dr. Wilkin

10/27/16
Caleb starting to code collisions.

Worked for hours on getting bomb collisions and level changes to no prevail. Level changes work around 50% of the time
in debug mode but never in regular mode.

We worked for like 2-3 hours this morning fixing our actionlistener and movement (Caleb coding)
We worked for like 2-3 hours this afternoon making collisions work, as well as bomb placement (Caleb/Ben 75/25%)
Ben worked alone for 30 mins fixing bomb collisions then we met in one of the labs and fully debugged bomb collisions
and then implemented loading levels (45 mins) (where flickering the frame fixed everything) (Ben coding)
