Some work don in class on Tuesday and Wednesday

Friday: Added a new enemy, messed around with audio a little, tried to fix level loading (Both coded equally - about 2 hrs total)

Saturday: 
         
         11:50 pm:
            Ben coded for about 3 hours on pause(p), player's lives, attempted to fix win conditions (stuck)
            Caleb coded for about 3 hours on making powerups - got stuck on bigger explosions still bugged - 
            level 4 has all powerup bricks (just mash 'u' to get there)
            
            there are numerous bugs still in the code, but the game is semi-functional with a new enemy
