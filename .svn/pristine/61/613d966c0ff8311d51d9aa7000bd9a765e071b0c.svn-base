Ben coded for about 2 hours on the abstract game object and the classes that extend it, as well as starting to implement

Caleb Coded for the next 2 hours working on trying to get LevelPanel to draw the level, to no avail. We are having major
issues with BufferedImage and are stuck, so we are going to throw in the towel for the night and talk to Dr. Wilkin 
tomorrow.
